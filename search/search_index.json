Follow the beat to beat the game.</p> <p>Thinking better now about the game to improve its quality and concept here are some ideas that came up:</p> Topic Idea Theme &amp; Ambient 80's 90's style.  Electronic and Synthwave Game Mechanich Music's beat control the actions of the player  E.g.: FireRate, special actions, etc. Game Mechanic <code>Look above as this idea links to the previous</code>  Music is chosen by the player's playlist or defined by the game and the player should choose. Game Mechanic <code>Look above as this idea links to the previous</code>  The game has a tools such as a DJ Sampler to create musics to save and use in the game. Game's Visual Feature <code>Look above as this idea links to the previous</code>  The musics are stored in cassete tapes that become availables to choose from in a specific menu. (they could be showcase floating and highlighted rotating back and forth in 30\u00b0 ). Style 3D Game Enemies Enimies are some kind of alien life form (symbiotes) that are sensitive/weak to sound waves like Venom from Spider-Man.  They could be weak to a specific frequency, rythm or sound sequence combination. Enemies Their life could be shown not as lifebars, but represented by their color/behaviour/etc. Enemies They only die from a certain \"combo\". Camera 3\u00b0 Person from side view with lateral scrolling.  E.g.: Castle Crashers Camera TPS Research Look into games that uses rythm or music as part of their mechanic such as:  - Metal Hellsinger  - Guitar Hero  - Geometry Dash  - Deemo / Cytus  Look into this link for more examples."}]}
