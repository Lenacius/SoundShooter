# Log 001 - Context and Ideas
`Date: 01/08/2023 and 30/07/2023` | `Original log on WhatsApp`

With the start of a new semester it comes the start of time organization.

This logbook on GitHub will be my way of registering findings and decisions for my Final Paper (part 1 and 2) for my undergrad in Digital Games of UNISINOS.

## Context of Final Paper Idea

One of the possibilities for this paper is the development of a game.

And this is what I'm gonna do.

To give more context about the idea, some semesters ago I've had a class about Computer Animation, in the name is obvious, but this class showed different kinds of techniques to animate objetcs (e.g.: Procedural Animation, Physically Based Dynamics, etc).

In one of the assignments of this class I've developed the prototype of a game that uses a music's beat as a form to control the fire rate of the character's weapons depending of the gun and frequencies of the music.

This project met its first end when this class ended, but it returned later in my lastest semester in the class of Special Topics in Digital Games where I had to use a game with the code available to use for game testing and related topics.

Looking at the game and the feedback from some colleagues, I got motivation to work in this project as it relates to differents topics that interests me such and Music, Game Development and Design.

## Game Idea

In the original repository of the project, there isn't a description of the game idea, so here's the game's pitch:

> Sound Shooter is a action TPS where you just control your character's movement, the shooting is controlled by "background" music's beat. Follow the beat to beat the game.

Thinking better now about the game to improve its quality and concept here are some ideas that came up:

| Topic | Idea |
| --- | --- |
| Theme & Ambient | 80's 90's style. <br> Electronic and Synthwave |
| Game Mechanich | Music's beat control the actions of the player <br> E.g.: FireRate, special actions, etc.  |
| Game Mechanic | `Look above as this idea links to the previous` <br> Music is chosen by the player's playlist or defined by the game and the player should choose. |
| Game Mechanic | `Look above as this idea links to the previous` <br> The game has a tools such as a DJ Sampler to create musics to save and use in the game. |
| Game's Visual Feature | `Look above as this idea links to the previous` <br> The musics are stored in cassete tapes that become availables to choose from in a specific menu. (they could be showcase floating and highlighted rotating back and forth in 30° ). |
| Style | 3D Game |
| Enemies | Enimies are some kind of alien life form (symbiotes) that are sensitive/weak to sound waves like Venom from Spider-Man. <br> They could be weak to a specific frequency, rythm or sound sequence combination. |
| Enemies | Their life could be shown not as lifebars, but represented by their color/behaviour/etc. |
| Enemies | They only die from a certain "combo". |
| Camera | 3° Person from side view with lateral scrolling. <br> E.g.: Castle Crashers |
| Camera | TPS |
| Research | Look into games that uses rythm or music as part of their mechanic such as: <br> - Metal Hellsinger <br> - Guitar Hero <br> - Geometry Dash <br> - Deemo / Cytus <br> Look into this [link](https://gametimes.com.br/jogos-de-ritmo/) for more examples. |
