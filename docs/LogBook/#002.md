    Original console: Playstation 2

    Guitar Hero is a classic rythm game focused in simulating the experience of playing rock band songs with a guitar, bass, drums, etc.

    The game itself is fairly simple and became more popular with it specific guitar controllers.

    The game screen have 5 lanes represented by the colors green, red, yellow, blue and orange. In those lanes circles would come down and the player should hit the note in the right spot of each lane based on the instruments notes, pressing the button corresping to the lane and flipping the switch of the guitar controller. Making this the basic mechanic of the game.

    Some notes could be long (single tap, maintaining the note pressed), normal(single tap on the note), hammered (only the note could be pressed, not needing to flip) or have multiple notes at the same time.

    Other features are the score, which increases on hits depending of the timing of the player to hit the notes. The rock meter, that would vary depending of the player's accuracy to play the notes, in case of miss the gauge would decrease and if it reached 0, the song would stop and the level failed.

    Another cool mechanic the the star power that would double the points awarded, this power would be enabled by some specific parts of the song if the player got all the sequence right,

    The game itself could have or not a story to tell, and with the pass of time the mechanics would become more refined and the game's repertoire would increase, adding different commands for different instruments, etc. But the core would stay the same.

    Original console: Smartphones

    Deemo follows the same logic from Guitar Hero, with the core of the game based on the player following the rythm of the music and playing the notes on the right time.

    Varying from Guitar Hero, Deemo focus more on the story of the game and on piano songs.

    Being built for smartphones, the player would have not only 5 buttons in the screen to play, but the hole line of the screen would be played, because the notes could come in different positions of the X axis.

    Similar to Guitar Hero there could be hold notes, or just tap notes, but the player don't have a score, and the player check its progress by how much percentage of the music it got (based of how well it timed the notes) and instead of failing a level, the player could continue playing even if it missed half of the music.
